I work as a Product Manager with experience in healthcare, fashion, and financial services. I hold a degree in Business Administration from Insper, with specializations in Marketing, Operations, and Technology. I am passionate about continuous learning, innovation, and the strategic application of data to solve complex problems.

Currently, I am transitioning and growing professionally by deepening my knowledge in data science and analytics, focusing on tools like Python, matplotlib, and seaborn. I view learning as a continuous process, much like mastering a new language, and see working with data as a pathway to transforming ideas into practical and sustainable solutions.

On GitHub, I aim to share projects that reflect my progress in leveraging data to support strategic decisions, uncover patterns in complex systems, and create visualizations that communicate insights clearly and effectively.
